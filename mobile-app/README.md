# E-Commerce Mobile App (Expo Conversion)

This is a fully-featured e-commerce mobile application for iOS and Android, built with Expo and React Native. It is a conversion of the original Next.js web application.

## Features

- Browse and search for products.
- View product details.
- Add items to a persistent shopping basket.
- A placeholder checkout flow.
- A T-shirt design studio for creating custom products.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version)
- npm or yarn
- Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device for testing.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Navigate to the mobile app directory:**
    ```bash
    cd mobile-app
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Environment Variables

This project requires a `.env` file in the `mobile-app` directory to store credentials for the Sanity backend. Create a file named `.env` and add the following variables:

```
# .env

# Sanity.io Credentials
# Get these from your Sanity project dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID="fjq8mivd"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET="production"
SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN="your_sanity_read_token"

```
**Note:** The Sanity client in this project is pre-configured with a read-only token. For features that require writing data (like creating real orders), you would need to implement secure, server-side handling of a write token.

## Running the Application

Once dependencies are installed, you can run the app on your device using the Expo Go app:

-   **To run on iOS:**
    ```bash
    npm run ios
    ```
-   **To run on Android:**
    ```bash
    npm run android
    ```
-   **To run in a web browser:**
    ```bash
    npm run web
    ```

Scan the QR code generated in your terminal with the Expo Go app.

## Project Structure

-   `/app`: Contains all the screens and navigation logic, powered by Expo Router.
-   `/assets`: Static assets like images and fonts.
-   `/components`: Reusable components used across multiple screens (e.g., `ProductThumb`, `Toolbar`).
-   `/lib`: Helper functions and services, including the Sanity client and data fetching functions.
-   `/store`: Zustand stores for global state management (e.g., shopping basket, editor state).
-   `/constants`: App-wide constants like color schemes.
